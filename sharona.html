        <p>Sharona</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article-container-body">
        <p>
          Sharona had already slammed one beer, being the hostess and birthday
          girl, she got first dibs; and the edge it had taken off facilitated
          another level of volume. She turned to Jacob, who, engaged in
          conversation with his friend, seemed unaware of her existence.
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Hey. HEY!&quot;</p>
        <p>He looked over at her.</p>
        <p>
          &quot;What&#39;s going on? My friends haven&#39;t got any drinks and
          the food is coming out so slowly.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Her face showed a mixed expression of annoyance at the situation and
          embarrassment for her recommending this place to her friends. She also
          conveyed a hope that her husband would help her while she could
          entertain her friends. But he sloughed her off like dead skin and
          turned back to his conversation. It was painfully obvious to many of
          the guests of the tension between the two. Some played it down and
          awkwardly laughed it off, others pretended to ignore it. Sharona
          suddenly shoved out her chair and went up to the waiter. In half
          English and half Japanese, she said, &quot;We haven&#39;t received our
          beers yet! Doshite? Biru mada kimasen.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The waiter stiffened like a prey animal detecting its predator. He
          avoided eye contact with Sharona and nervously looked about the room
          for someone to come to his rescue or at least give him a survival
          clue. Sharona was spouting off somewhat comprehensible language, but
          to the waiter they were ungodly noises. To the young waiter, Sharona
          probably bore a lot of resemblance to Typhoeus, who had a hundred
          terrifying snake-heads with licking black tongues coming out of his
          shoulders, and the eyes flashed fire; and there were voices in all of
          the monstrous heads, emitting every kind of inexpressible sound. The
          waiter nearly dropped the plate of food in his right hand but managed
          to slide it onto the table. He side stepped her, lunged up the steps,
          and ran back to the kitchen, thereby wiggling out of Sharona&#39;s
          Medusian stare before being completely rendered helpless.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Sharona stomped back to the table, her husband had mysteriously
          vanished. He had snuck away outside for a smoke and a chat with his
          friend. Sharona pretended not to notice but the queer quiver that
          appeared at the corner of her mouth gave her away. She slumped down
          and placed her hand on the one-third full, now warm, glass of beer,
          but didn&#39;t drink it. She just let her hand become moist from the
          condensation. Her shoulders hung off her like a bodysuit that was too
          big; she looked smaller than normal. Her eyebrows, usually secondary
          to her large, full- blooming, sky-blue eyes, now wrestled for
          dominance, and with each passing second, seemed to overtake more and
          more of her face. They steadily began to eclipse her eyes like the
          moon the sun, and soon engulfed her entire forehead with their
          domineering, chaotic twitching.
        </p>
        <p>
          She picked up the glass and held it a few inches above the table. Her
          concentration was entirely focused on the glass, or so it seemed. Her
          eyebrow movement, upon closer inspection, appeared less chaotic, even
          rhythmic, like they were dancing to the syncopation of a waltz—the
          third movement of the Jupiter symphony, perhaps. The descending
          chromatic line jumped from eyebrow to eyebrow, as if possessed. Her
          hand, which tightly gripped the handle of the glass mug, moved up
          closer to her lips. The three staccato Ds, through sheer dominance,
          contorted Sharona&#39;s face and reanimated her eyes as the music held
          high on the unstable E, then stumbled down defiantly, as if resisting
          its fate. But this was futile. As the cadence approached, her eyes
          radiated stellar clarity and synchronicity. The instruments aligned
          themselves on the powerful G chord, and the universe was harmonious;
          and Sharona, overcome by hellish anger, her face grotesque and
          misshapen, hurled the glass towards the floor, smashing it to
          smithereens, instantly forcing the restaurant to a halt.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was over an hour into the party and a few pizzas and french fries
          had been out to the table, not nearly enough food for four, let alone
          for fourteen. Everyone was more than annoyed but tried to maintain
          composure for the birthday girl&#39;s sake. The atmosphere was
          constricting in the stale, stuffy smoke-filled basement. The mess from
          Sharona&#39;s glass had been shoddily mopped up and the wet patch on
          the floor gave off an unbecoming sheen. Jacob scuffed his way back to
          the room and collapsed carelessly into his seat, conversing with his
          friend and ignoring Sharona and the rest. His face, being mostly made
          of cheeks, had a soft, airy look and feel, which mirrored his
          intelligence: loosey-goosey and vapid. He hadn&#39;t the slightest
          clue of what had occurred just twenty minutes ago, but there was
          little evidence that he would have noticed had he been there; or
          worse, he may have noticed but ignored it. Other than the smashed
          glass, Sharona had, for the most part, maintained her outbursts. But
          she now began, as the alcohol disinhibited her, to get snappy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Billy and Mike and a few others were engaged in a drinking game. The
          first to go named an actor, the next had to name a movie the actor was
          in, the next had to name another actor from that movie, and so on,
          until one couldn&#39;t guess the actor or movie, and therefore had to
          drink. It was a game for cinephiles, such as Billy and Mike, but they
          enjoyed playing with anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharona hollered across the table. &quot;Your bullshit games suck. Why
          can&#39;t we play something for everyone? I hate that fucking
          game.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          She took a deep breath and seemed to have more to say but shifted her
          eyes back to an empty glass and became angered again at the lack of
          service. Her cheeks now ruddy with blood, leapt up with the rest of
          her as she pushed her chair out noisily and stood, a little wobbly,
          determined to get beer. Jacob, gently startled to half-attention by
          the sudden intensity, attempted to mollify the situation. But Sharona
          didn&#39;t take his words well.
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I&#39;m drunk? Calm down?&quot;</p>
        <p>She got louder with each utterance.</p>
        <p>
          &quot;It&#39;s my fucking party with my friends who aren&#39;t
          drinking because we can&#39;t get served properly and you won&#39;t do
          anything about it and don&#39;t care—&quot; She cut herself off and
          rolled her eyes, bored by the conversation having had it many times
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somewhere between Jacob&#39;s cheeks more gibberish bubbled out,
          &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot; He asked. &quot;Why don&#39;t I
          just go up and tell them to bring our food? Oh, great idea.
          That&#39;ll work. I&#39;ll hop up and down and make a scene. But that
          wouldn&#39;t be original. I&#39;d just be copying you—Ugh! Sit down.
          Relax.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Other diners around in the restaurant felt the tense, sticky
          atmosphere that pervaded the room. Hushed comments and judgments were
          made. Sharona, rather than simply not caring less about what other
          people heard or thought, in fact, wanted them to hear, as she felt it
          would embarrass and shame Jacob more than her. She felt a vengeful
          pride bubbling inside and hoped—a hope that felt so ingrained, so
          primordial—that she could disgrace and humiliate him, as he was doing
          to her. Jacob, however, was already back chatting with his friend and
          had forgotten Sharona was standing there glaring at him—she might as
          well have been an apparition. His flippant attitude towards the entire
          situation and his callousness towards Sharona and her friends were
          simply too much for Sharona to overcome. Sharona felt a sharp pain run
          along the back side of her lower rib area. Sweat beads gathered around
          her eyebrows as her body temperature heated up. She swiped at her
          forehead to remove some of the sweat. Tears started to accumulate and
          left a shimmer in her eyes. She took a long, deep breath and closed
          her eyes for three or four seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she opened them, two waiters finally were bringing in food and
          drinks. They shone with the brilliance of Gabriel bringing good news
          from Heaven: six pitchers of beer, glittering like gold offerings, and
          the mountains of food on white plates like flags of surrender for
          peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone, just a moment ago nearly in a state of panic, relaxed their
          taut faces and started to build up some chatter to liven things up.
          The waiters, one behind the other, feeling the sense of relief and joy
          filling the room, quickened their steps in excitement. The first
          waiter, carrying a heavy load and a big smile, jauntily jumped down
          the steps onto the wet floor and flung himself head over heels into
          the table, dousing Jacob and his friend with beer and whisky. The next
          waiter tried to stop but much too quickly jerked backwards, sending
          the food flying into another group behind him. The restaurant was a
          complete mess. Sharona laughed viciously and stormed out of the
          restaurant, leaving her friends, mouths and eyes open in disbelief,
          still hungry and sober after nearly two hours.
