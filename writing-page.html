              On February 14th we went to an Oscar Wilde play in Vancouver, “The
              Importance of being Earnest,” it was. The weather was chilly, to
              put it mildly, and we’d dressed the part, in big overcoats,
              gloves, and scarfs. He wore black Doc Martens (was there any other
              colour?) which was a good sounding shoe—by that I mean, when you
              walked, the shoe against the ground had a pleasant sound, very
              comforting. My shoes sounded rather tinny, but I could never bring
              myself to purchase the big clunky Doc Martens as I preferred more
              sleek-looking shoes. There’s always a trade off. When we arrived
              at the theatre, romantically lit, it had a wonderfully welcoming
              ambience in the otherwise cold and dark night. We were ushered in
              by a slender man with shimmering blue eyes that suggested he was
              happier than usual, perhaps he found out his wife was pregnant. He
              tore our tickets in half and off we went to the bar for a
              cocktail.

              Corporal Theodore “Ted” Lyon was a trained land surveyor from the
              British Army. When I knew him he was just recently divorced from
              his wife and quite upset about it. He said, “You know, John, you
              always think she’ll come back, and then you call to see how she is
              and some guy answers the phone.”

              Jesus Christ! What could I say? I was only nineteen at the time,
              and had only known him for a few months. He scared the shit out of
              me.
            </p>

              He was sitting in the dark with a downturned face and hunched
              shoulders, his usual look for the past week, when I came in one
              morning.
            </p>

              “You know she’s changed her look,” he said, startling me. “She
              used to always wear her hair down and now it’s always up. Felt
              like I didn’t even know her.”

              Sharona had already slammed one beer, being the hostess and
              birthday girl, she got first dibs; and the edge it had taken off
              facilitated another level of volume. She turned to Jacob, who,
              engaged in conversation with his friend, seemed unaware of her
              existence.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Hey. HEY!&quot;</p>
            <p>He looked over at her.</p>
            <p>
              &quot;What&#39;s going on? My friends haven&#39;t got any drinks
              and the food is coming out so slowly.&quot;

            <p>
              Her face showed a mixed expression of annoyance at the situation
              and embarrassment for her recommending this place to her friends.
              She also conveyed a hope that her husband would help her while she
              could entertain her friends. But he sloughed her off like dead
              skin and turned back to his conversation. It was painfully obvious

              Tommy always wore his Carling jacket. It was a kind of charcoal
              colour, or maybe it was just faded black, with breast pockets and
              a name tag. His name was written in cursive and was pretty worn
              out. The letters actually looked like “Tammy” instead of “Tommy,”
              which I thought was quite funny. I asked him about it once and he
              told me to fuck off. I asked Dan about it and he didn’t say
              anything, but was more polite about it. After that I just let it
              go, and though I didn’t really care, the strange fact that they
              didn’t say anything about it made me curious.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whenever I saw Dan and Tommy together, they each always had one
              eye on the other, as if at any moment one of them might combust
              and neither wanted to miss it. And for the short time I’d been at
              the brewery, the only conflict I saw was between those two. So I
              was rather surprised when an angry girl in her twenties stormed in
              looking for Tommy. Glen was helping me move bottles, and by
              helping I mean talking about cars, but I didn’t mind.
